# Disclaimer

**This one is something from my good old days**

Of course, I would reconsider a lot of things done here :)

- This a telegram bot to share direct links to Wikipedia based on the request.
- It's a plain java application
- It has some custom logger, HTTP client etc., which was popular approach those days
- Also some old code style with prefixes, that was useful for the SVN code reviews in browser...

# Requirements

- java 8
- initially it wasn't wrapped with gradle, but I added it just to have modern approach and comfortability
- jar includes dependencies, so it's ready to just be used
